    <h1>Carbon Footprint Calculator!!</h1>
    <p>
        Every action we take – from the food we eat to the way we travel – leaves a mark on our planet.
        This mark is called your <b>carbon footprint</b>, which measures the total greenhouse gases you emit into the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why does it matter? Because climate change is real, and every ton of carbon dioxide contributes to global warming,
        extreme weather, rising seas, and loss of biodiversity. But the good news is: small conscious choices can make a huge difference.
